## Problem Statement
While majority of the tier 1 and tier 2 college students in India have adequate amount of exposure to choose what they want to pursue and how they want to pursue it, there is still a majority of tier 3 college students who don't get to have this advantage. With less time on learning and more time on struggling to find a path to get into a tech company, these students not only need guidance but resources which are either affordable or mostly free.
